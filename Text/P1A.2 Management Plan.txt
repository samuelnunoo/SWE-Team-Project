MEETINGS AND PROGRESS MONITORING:

In lab on Friday we will set meetings for the next week to make sure everyone can make it, and plan according to what we need to get done, since some weeks with more individual tasks we will not need to meet for long blocks of time 

We will create a Github Repository, and after completing each assignment in Google Docs, Rose will transfer the document as a .txt file to Github to stay organized 

We will meet as a group on Zoom on Friday after lab each week for 15 minutes to update the plan weekly, and make sure that our initial delegations still work. 

We will meet on Sundays at 10 am to go over any deliverables and review any issues as a group.

We will communicate through Messenger daily to update our progress, and if anything goes wrong we can get as many people addressing the issue as we can, through Zoom as it requires
