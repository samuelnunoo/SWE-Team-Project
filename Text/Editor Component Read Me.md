# Editor Component Read Me

In order to check-out, build, run, and test my component, you'll need to have the following dependencies. Node JS can be downloaded at https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and Yarn can be acquired from https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/. Node should be installed before Yarn. 

For the stable version of my code from Github, clone the repository SWE-Team-Project from the master branch. The Editor code is located in the pages folder in the nuxt folder at SWE-Team-Project/nuxt/pages/Editor.vue, and the tests are located at SWE-Team-Project/nuxt/test/Editor.spec.js. 

You should open the project in an IDE ideally, our team used VSCode. After making sure the current directory is the nuxt folder, using the command ```yarn``` in the command line, all dependencies will start downloading and installing, and the build will begin. Once all dependencies are installed, we can run the testing file with the command ```npm test -- Editor.spec.js```.
